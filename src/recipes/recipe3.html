    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Apple fritter pancakes make a wonderful breakfast topped with some warmed
      maple syrup and served with some breakfast meats. You can use any type of
      apple for this recipe—I used Honeycrisp (Fuji works great, too), but the
      sweeter the better. If you are using a tart apple, add another tablespoon
      of sugar.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded apple</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine egg, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, kosher salt, and vanilla
        extract in a bowl. Whisk until well combined and lightly foamy. Add
        shredded apple and lemon juice and fold in with a spatula until well
        combined. Add flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix until flour
        disappears and batter is thick yet spoonable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add tablespoonfuls of apple
        batter to the hot butter and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn
        and cook until apple pancakes spring back to the touch and are browned
        on the other side, an additional 3 minutes.
