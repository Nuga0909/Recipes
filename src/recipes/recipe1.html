    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ gallon warm whole milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 large egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
      <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons freshly grated orange zest</li>
      <li>¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
      <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour warmed milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle
        attachment for the dough. Sprinkle yeast evenly over the surface of the
        milk. Let stand until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add egg and egg yolk, butter, honey, orange zest, and orange juice to
        the yeast mixture. Beat on low until combined, about 45 seconds. Add 2
        cups flour; beat on low until a wet dough forms, about 1 minute. Turn
        off mixer; switch to the dough hook attachment. Add 1 1/2 cups flour and
        salt, beat on medium until dough is soft and elastic, 7 to 10 minutes.
        If necessary, add an additional 1/2 cup flour, tablespoon by tablespoon,
        using as little as possible to achieve a soft dough. The dough should be
        quite sticky. Gather dough into a ball and transfer to a large greased
        bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise at room temperature
        until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest for the filling
        in a bowl. Mix with a spatula until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute.
        Set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and transfer to a well-floured surface. Roll dough
        into a large 10 x 18-inches rectangle. Spread the filling over the
        surface of the dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border along the top long edge.
        Roll the dough away from you to create a log, and pinch seam to seal.
        Cut dough log into 12 equal rolls (about 1 1/2 inches wide). Transfer
        rolls to a greased 13 x 9 inch baking dish. Loosely cover with plastic
        wrap, and set aside to rise at room temperature until puffy and almost
        doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.
